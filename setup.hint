sdesc: "Tk OpenGL rendering widget"
ldesc: "Togl is a Tk widget for OpenGL rendering. Togl does almost no OpenGL
drawing itself, instead it manages OpenGL drawing by calling various Tcl
commands (a.k.a., callback functions). Those commands can be C functions
that call OpenGL (in)directly or another Tcl package."
